### Revision  

### Scope  

Teamd warm-restart with LACP in slow mode is already supported in the community version. This design is an enhancement to support teamd warm-restart with LACP in fast mode. 
This design is unable to handle teamd unplanned restart, That is to say, If the teamd container is restarted by restarting the teamd service, The peer side is affected, resulting in link flapping and traffic loss.

### Overview 

We expect the restart of teamd docker should not cause link flapping or any traffic loss. All lags at data plane should remain the same. But it's hard to implement in some scenarios.

During teamd warm-restart, the control plane remains up for a maximum of 90 seconds in LACP slow mode. However, in LACP fast mode, the control plane can only remain up for 3 seconds. This is because LACPDUs are sent every second. LACP protocol considers a LAG to be down if three LACPDUs are not received.

Teamd containers are not restarted that fast, so teamd warm-restart in LACP fast mode always results in lag down and the kernel LAG state in mess. However, in a data center, it is necessary to set LACP to fast mode to ensure faster link convergence and less traffic loss.

Let's take a look at the scenario shown in the figure below, there are multiple LAGs between switch_a and switch 1-n and LACP in fast mode, We can only control switch_a, other devices belong to other organizations and are not under our control. we want to upgrade the teamd container of switch_a without causing link flapping on other devices. Therefore, supporting teamd warm-restart in LACP fast mode is very important. With this feature, we can support teamd bug hotfixes and smooth upgrades.

This design supports teamd warm-restart by switching between active and standby teamd container.

### Requirements

Support warm-restart teamd in LACP fast/slow mode

LACP protocol is not modified, Lacp interaction is not affected

### Limitations

This design does not support the warm-reboot process. The reason is that during warm-reboot process, the kernel has been reset and the local end cannot continue to interact with the peer, which will be aware of the warm-reboot process.

During the teamd warm-restart process, no modification of the teamd-related configuration is allowed.

### Architecture Design 

This feature does not change the existing SONiC architecture.

### High-Level Design 

During the teamd warm-restart process, a new Teamd container is created, and the old and new teamd containers need to be fully synchronized before the old teamd container is killed. After the sonic_installer upgrade_docker teamd action, only the new teamd container is left in the system. 

The process is divided into the following stages:
stage 1: Waiting for ready state. We need to wait for all LAG processes to be created in the new teamd container and wait for processes to synchronize with the kernel module. 
stage 2: Role change state. The old LAG processes are terminated with SIGUSR1 and the new LAG processes are enabled with SIGUSR2.
stage 3: Warm-restart finish state. The old teamd container will exit, and only the new teamd container is left.

The Teamd container contains multiple processes, such as teamd, teammgrd, teamdctl, teamsyncd, etc. teamd process can send and receive LACPDUs with the peer through the port. teamd can update the kernel module (team.ko) status via Netlink. teamsyncd can receive Netlink events and convert them to ASIC as configuration through SWSS.

During the teamd warm-restart process, the module interactions change as followsï¼š
stage 1: Waiting for ready state. The new teamd only receives data, and the interaction with the teamd container is one-way. The new teamd container does not modify the parameters of the kernel module and ASIC

stage 2: Role change state. Old teamd processes receive SIGUSR1 and send the last LACPDU to the partner, Interacting with the new teamd container will become two-way.  The new teamd container start sending LACPDUs, and start modifying the parameters of the kernel module and ASIC

stage 3: Warm-restart finish state. The old teamd container exits without setting parameters for the kernel or ASIC.

The flow of the teamd warm-restart process is as follows:
* a1. rename teamd container to teamd_bak container
* a2. create a new teamd container. (teamd flow: If teamd starts with the warm-restart flag, LACPDU is not sent and the parameters of the kernel module are not changed, but inconsistent data with kernel parameters need to be recorded in memory.)
* a3. wait for the teamd processes to ok in the new teamd container. Run teamdctl to get the new teamd status.
* b1. use SIGUSR1 to stop the old teamd processes. teamd and teamd_bak containers can share files so that the record files of LACPDU can be passed from the old container to the new one. (teamd flow: When SIGUSR1 is received, the old design is reused, the LACPDU record file is generated, and exit)
* b2. wait for SIGUSR1 processing, which must less than 3 seconds. Otherwise, LAG considers down.
* b3. use SIGUSR2 to apply data with the new teamd processes. (teamd flow: When SIGUSR2 is received, We will compare the data with the kernel and set the new data to the kernel and ASIC, start sending LACPDU, and update the kernel parameters in real-time when the LACP status changes)
* c1. delete teamd_bak container

The process of sonic_installer rollback_docker is the same as that for warm-restart above.

Same as regular LAG testbed. LAG Configures LACP in fast mode, run sonic_installer upgrade_docker --warm teamd docker-teamd.gz -y on DUT will not cause link flapping or any traffic loss.
